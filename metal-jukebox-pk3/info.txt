FROM V3.2 TO V3.5
===========================
- 25 more songs.
- SpawnForced was introduced into Zandronum since the update. ZDoom check
  rewritten with this in mind.
- nomusic was a server cvar instead of a user cvar. This has been fixed.
- The DemonSteele check would break at seemingly random times and summon a
  Revenant to punch the player. This has been fixed.


FROM V3 TO V3.2
===========================
- 25 more songs.
- Conversion of cvar handling from ConsoleCommand to cvarinfo.


FROM V2 TO V3:
===========================
- 75 more songs!
- Judas Priest's Tyrant had a random beep around the 0:56-ish mark. This has been
  fixed.
- Dark ambient music has been removed and replaced. This is a pack for jamming to
  super-cheesy and tinny music, not getting 2spook'd.
- White Zombie's Temple of the Bull wasn't a song we were able to find any info
  on. We're not even sure it's actually a real song. It was replaced with a new
  White Zombie song, Black Sunshine.
- It's now possible to change exactly to the song you want. Input "song" and then
  a number in the console, like "song 142", and it'll swap to that exact song.
- All song info has been given tan and white coloring for easier differentiation.
- Thanks to Marrub's incredible work, even the song amount now is clientsided.
  People are now able to add, remove, and adjust songs as they want without any
  issues in joining servers!
- Hitting "Next Song" and manually selecting a song no longer requires the
  norandommusic cvar to be set to 0.
- Corrected some mistaken song information:
  ^- Barathrum's Warmetal is off the album Infernal.
  ^- Linkin Park's Crawling is off the album Hybrid Theory.
  ^- Battlelore's Stormmaster was renamed to the proper Swordmaster.
  ^- Song 186 was credited to Cannical Corpse instead of Cannibal Corpse.
  ^- Sanctuary's Die for My Sins and Taste Revenge are Thrash Metal.


FROM V1c TO V2:
===========================
- 100 more songs!
- Removed and replaced Rammstein's Engel with Feuer Frei, due to Engel messing up
  in-game and playing ring tones instead.
- Added a "default song" button to play the level's standard music.
- Moved all song info to LANGUAGE, for people to edit at their leisure if they
  replace the music.
- Messages now no longer overlap and will replace each other.
- Necroticism - Descanting the Insalubrious had an unreadable symbol that was
  refusing to be read properly.
- Corrected some mistaken song information:
  ^- A Succubus In Rapture was not by set_abominae, it was by Dimmu Borgir.
  ^- Rammstein has identified as Neue Deutsche Harte.
  ^- Annihilator has never identified their genre as groove metal.
  ^- Biohazard has identified as Hardcore.
  ^- Ea, Lord of the Depths was on the album Burzum.
  ^- Alice in Chains is decisively Grunge.
  ^- The Midnight Carnival is Speed, not Power.
  ^- Children of Bodom's songs have been labeled Melodic Death.
  ^- Fear Factory is Industrial Metal, not Death Metal.
  ^- Graveworm is now Melodic Black Metal.
  ^- Hexen is now Thrash Metal.
  ^- Lamb of God is now metalcore.
  ^- Refuse/Resist was on Chaos A.D., not Confuse A.D.
  ^- Reviewers have identified Celtic Frost's To Mega Therion (not Thyrion)
     album as Death Metal.
